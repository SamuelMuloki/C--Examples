/* Note : According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer
that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive
divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a
perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including
itself).
